## Architecture & Design Patterns

### System Architecture

The HRMS follows a **layered modular architecture** with clear separation of concerns:

### Design Patterns Implemented

1. **Service Layer Pattern**: All business logic is encapsulated in service classes
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access is abstracted through Mongoose models
3. **Middleware Pattern**: Cross-cutting concerns (auth, validation) handled via middleware
4. **Auto-Increment Pattern**: Custom ID generation using Counter collection
5. **Multi-Tenancy Pattern**: Data isolation through `organization_id` fields
6. **RBAC Pattern**: Role-based permissions enforced at route level

---

## Core Business Modules

### 1. Authentication Module

**Purpose**: Secure user authentication and session management

**Business Rules**:
- Users must register before accessing the system
- Password must be hashed using bcryptjs before storage
- JWT tokens expire after configured duration
- Users can only logout while authenticated
- Multiple concurrent sessions allowed per user

**Workflow**:
```
1. User Registration
   - Validate email uniqueness
   - Hash password with bcrypt
   - Associate with organization
   - Generate JWT token
   - Return token to client

2. User Login
   - Validate credentials
   - Compare hashed password
   - Generate JWT token
   - Update last login timestamp
   - Return token

3. Token Validation (Middleware)
   - Verify token signature
   - Check expiration
   - Validate user exists
   - Attach user to request
   - Allow request to proceed
```

**Data Integrity**:
- Email must be unique per organization
- Password minimum 8 characters
- User accounts can be soft-deleted
- Failed login attempts tracked

---

### 2. Organization Module

**Purpose**: Multi-tenant organization management

**Business Rules**:
- Each organization is completely isolated
- Organizations have subscription plans
- HR policies configured per organization
- Client Admin assigned per organization
- Organization settings cascade to all resources

**Key Attributes**:
- Organization hierarchy (parent-child)
- Subscription status (Active/Suspended/Expired)
- HR/payroll policy defaults
- Integration settings
- Billing information

**Data Isolation**:
All data access queries automatically filter by `organization_id` unless user is Super Admin

---

### 3. User & Role Module

**Purpose**: User management and access control

**Business Rules**:
- Users belong to one organization
- Users can have multiple roles
- Permissions follow `resource:action` pattern
- Role hierarchy enforced (Super Admin > Client Admin > Employee)
- Self-service profile updates allowed

**Role Hierarchy**:
```
Super Admin
    ↓
Client Admin
    ↓
HR Account Manager / Payroll Specialist / Recruitment Specialist
    ↓
Employee / Nurse / Doctor / Technician
```

**Permission Model**:
```javascript
{
  "resource": "payroll",
  "actions": ["read", "write", "export", "approve"]
}
```

---

## Multi-Tenancy & Data Isolation

### Tenant Isolation Strategy

**Approach**: Database-level isolation using `organization_id`

**Business Rules**:
- Every entity references `organization_id`
- Queries automatically filter by tenant
- Super Admin can access all tenants
- Cross-tenant access strictly prohibited

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Auto-filter by organization in queries
const query = {};
if (user.role !== 'Super Admin') {
  const organization = await Organization.findOne({ 
    clientAdmin: user.id 
  });
  query.organization_id = organization.organization_id;
}
```

---
